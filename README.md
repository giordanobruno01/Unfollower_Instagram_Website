4 go to the end of the page and click on "Download your information"

it might take a few minutes but instagram will send you a link when the file is ready, after that just download the file, extract the both "followers_1.json" and "following.json" and add to the program replacing the existing ones.

ps: the json files are inside the folder after you extract
